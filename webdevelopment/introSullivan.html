         Hello! This is my introduction to myself. I am a high school science teacher in Independence, Missouri, and I teach Earth Science, Physics, and Chemistry. I am originally from Saint Louis, but moved to Kansas City after college. I graduated from Mizzou, and I am excited to go back for my Master's! I do not have any web development training or experience, but I am excited to learn! I do not have any expectations, just trying to broaden my knowledge! I plan on using my new knowledge to better help my students learn in new and different ways. My favorite hobby is going for hikes and exploring nature. I also love trying new foods and different restaurants!
