Hello! This is my introduction to myself. I am a high school science teacher in Independence, Missouri, and I teach Earth Science, Physics, and Chemistry. I am originally from Saint Louis, but moved to Kansas City after college with a Secondary Education degree. I also minored in Geology, and I am very excited to be a tiger again! I do not have any web development training or experience, but I am excited to learn! I do not have any expectations, just trying to broaden my knowledge! I plan on using my new knowledge to better help my students learn in new and different ways. It will keep things fresh as well as help them understand the importance of technology. My favorite hobby is going for hikes and exploring nature with my fianc√© and our sweet Labrador. I also love trying new foods and different restaurants!
