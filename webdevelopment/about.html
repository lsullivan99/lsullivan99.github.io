        <h3>Credentials Page</h3>
        <p> My name is Lydia Sullivan, and I am from <em>Kansas City, Missouri</em>. As a highschooler, I became interested in Earth Science to the point where I decided to attend the <em>University of Missouri</em> to study Geology. As much as I loved Geology, being a teacher had always been in the back of my mind. I decided to switch my degree to Secondary Education with an Emphasis in Earth Science, and I minored in Geology. After college, I moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to teach at William Chrisman High School, where I have been teaching for the past three years! Not only have I taught Earth Science and Physical Science. I decided to get my master's in <b>Learning Technologies and Design</b> to help my students learn in new and exciting ways!</p>
